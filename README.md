Customer segmentation is a critical practice for businesses as it helps them **divide their customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or needs**. This approach allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and services more effectively. By understanding different customer segments, companies can target specific groups with personalized communication and promotions, increasing engagement, loyalty, and overall satisfaction. Additionally, segmentation helps in **optimizing resource allocation, improving sales conversion, and identifying new market opportunities, ultimately leading to higher profitability and sustainable growth.**

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using **unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct groups within a customer base.** The goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions such as personalized marketing, product recommendations, and resource allocation. The dataset used contains key features like **age, gender, annual income, and spending score.** These were preprocessed through steps including data **cleaning, encoding, and feature scaling.** The analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior that can be translated into **actionable business strategies.**

## üéØ Key Objectives
**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Thoroughly **explore and clean the customer dataset** by handling missing values, normalizing features, and preparing the data for clustering.
**Segmentation of Customers:** Identify distinct customer segments based on **shared attributes and behaviors, providing a clear view** of the different customer groups.
**Clustering with K-Means:** Implement and fine-tune the K-Means clustering algorithm to **group customers into meaningful segments based on their characteristics.**
**Cluster Analysis and Insights:** Analyze the features of each customer segment to **uncover patterns and characteristics,** which can help design targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
